# 🎤 Voice Calculator

A simple, modern, browser-based **Voice Calculator** that lets you speak calculations like:

> "five plus three"  
> "six times two"  
> "twelve divided by four"

No keyboard required. Just speak, and the app recognizes your words, parses the operation, calculates, and even reads the result back to you!
